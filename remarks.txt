1. The centre of a circle coincides with the origin.
   The axes of an ellipse and of a helix lie on the coordinate axes,
   X/Y and Z respectively.
   A helix is right-handed and intersects the ray Ox.

2. The second container aggregates the syntactic circles.
   It will omit the ellipses with axes of the same length.

3. An optional command-line argument for the main program
   provides the seed for the random number generator.

4. The main program additionally outputs
   the names of the curves, along with the points and derivatives;
   the non-increasing sequence of the circles' radii;
   the sum of the circles' radii.

5. By using the makefile, there hopefully produced the library
   and two versions of the main program, demos and demo,
   dynamically and statically linked to the library.

6. The files libcurve.so.cpp and demos.cpp are symbolic links
   to curve.cpp and to demo.cpp purposed at building
   libcurve.so and demos via implicit make rules.
