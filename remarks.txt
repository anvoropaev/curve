1. The centre of a circle coincides with the origin.
   The axes of an ellipse and of a helix lie on the coordinate axes,
   X/Y and Z respectively.
   A helix is right-handed and intersects the ray Ox.

2. The second container aggregates the syntactic circles.
   It will omit the ellipses with axes of the same length.

3. The demo program additionally outputs
   the names of the curves, along with the points and derivatives;
   the non-increasing sequence of the circles' radii;
   the sum of the circles' radii.

4. In the omp program, the sum of radii is computed using the OpenMP facility.
   The container of circles is directly constructed. All the radii equal one.

5. The demo and the omp programs accept optional command-line arguments,
   as the seed for the random number generator and the number of circles
   respectively.

6. By using the makefile, there hopefully produced
   the shared library and the main programs, demo and omp.

7. The makefile is to be used in a GNU framework.
